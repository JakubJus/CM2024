# Sensor Fusion Web App

This app reads data from your **Polar Verity Sense** or **Seeed IMU** sensor and shows it in real-time on graphs.

## What You Need

- A browser that supports **Web Bluetooth** (Chrome or Edge)  
- Your sensor turned on and ready to pair  
- A local server (like VSCode Live Server) — opening the file directly might not work  

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser via a local server  
2. You’ll see three canvases: **Accelerometer**, **Gyro**, and **Sensor Fusion**  
3. Click **Start sensor** and select your sensor in the Bluetooth popup  
4. Watch the live graphs update with your sensor data  
5. Click **Stop sensor** to disconnect  
6. Click **Save to file** to download the data as JSON
